## Election Audit Summary
Dear Election Commission,

The script that I have created for the Colorado Board of Elections can be used (with some modifications) for any election.  In order to use this script, the following at a minimum would need to be modified:

1.  CSV file with the state or county election data
2.  Depending on which data you would like to extract (county, total votes, etc.), the script would need to be changed.  For instance, if the columns in the CSV file were different than the one used for the Colorado Board of Elections, the row headers would need to be updated.
